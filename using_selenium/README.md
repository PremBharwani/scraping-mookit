# Scraping HelloIITK using `Selenium`

### Usage :

You will have to install `selenium` and the driver for your respective browser. You can find the detailed installation guide [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)

To use this, you can set the properties accordingly in the `config.py` file. ( You will have to provide your HelloIITK ID and Password.)
And let the `scrape.py` script run now, you'll have the results stored in the form of a CSV file.

```$ python3 scrape.py```
